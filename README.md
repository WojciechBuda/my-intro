# Getting Started with Vite React

This project was initialized with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), the blazing fast frontend build tool for modern web development.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

### `npm run dev`

Starts the development server using Vite.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production using Vite's build command.

### `npm run lint`

Runs ESLint on the `src` directory, checking for JavaScript and JSX files. It includes the `--ext` flag to specify the file extensions, `--report-unused-disable-directives` flag to report unused ESLint disable directives, and `--max-warnings 0` flag to show no warnings.

### `npm run preview`

Starts a preview server to serve the production build of the app locally.

Refer to the [Vite documentation](https://vitejs.dev/) for more details on each script and how to customize the configuration.
